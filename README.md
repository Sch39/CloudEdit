####CloudEdit: A client side _jsFiddle_-like HTML Editor.  

- Supports HTML5/CSS3/jQuery1.x development.  
- Multiple themes and syntax highlighting thanks to __ACE__ editor.  
- Download compiled file support for most browsers:
  - Concatenates html/css/js to their inline equivalents for single-file download.  
- Toggle-able editor panes resize automatically based upon how many are displayed.  
- Uses sessionStorage for the current state in case of the 'accidental' browser refresh.  
- Uses localStorage to store the currently selected them for your next use.
